The Spy Drive project is an advanced, IoT-enabled surveillance system designed to deliver 
remote, real-time monitoring with enhanced mobility and adaptability. Powered by the ESP32
CAM module and motorized using an L298N driver, this project integrates video streaming 
capabilities with controllable camera movement, allowing users to monitor environments and 
adjust camera angles remotely via an intuitive web interface. 
Spy Drive’s core functionalities include live video streaming in MJPEG format over Wi-Fi, 
remote motorized control for dynamic panning and tilting, and an accessible interface for 
seamless control from any internet-connected device. The system’s ESP32-CAM module, 
equipped with an OV2640 camera sensor, captures and transmits high-quality video, which is 
ideal for applications like home security, industrial monitoring, and personal surveillance in 
dynamic environments. 

To program and initialize the ESP32-CAM, an FTDI TTL module is employed, streamlining 
the setup process. Spy Drive combines affordable hardware with practical IoT technology, 
resulting in a cost-effective yet powerful surveillance solution that meets the demands of 
modern security challenges. This project highlights the integration of embedded systems, real
time video streaming, and mobile surveillance, providing users with an innovative approach to 
remote monitoring and security.
